# wire-os

The main repo for WireOS.

WireOS serves as a nice, stable, and maintained base for Vector CFW.

This builds the OS, the /anki programs (`victor`), and creates a final OTA. This repo can be thought of as `wire-os-oelinux`.

## Submodules

- /anki/victor -> [wire-os-victor](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os-victor) (main)
- /anki/wired -> [wired](https://github.com/os-vector/wired) (main)

## Update notes:

- **05-21-2025**: you might want to run `./build/clean.sh "connman wpa-supplicant base-files systemd tzdata alsa-lib alsa-tools alsa-utils"` before building again
- **05-24-2025**: `./build/clean.sh "connman wpa-supplicant fake-hwclock initscript-anki"`
- **05-24-2025 again**: `./build/clean.sh "ethtool iptables-persistent"`
- **06-02-2025**: `./build/clean.sh "system-core"`
- **06-05-2025**: `./build/clean.sh "lvm2 libpam packagegroup-core-base-utils"`

## Build

- Note: you will need a somewhat beefy **x86_64 Linux** machine with at least 16GB of RAM and 100GB of free space.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), git, and wget.

2. Configure it so a regular user can use it:

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
newgrp docker
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
```

3. Clone and build:

```
git clone https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os --recurse-submodules
cd wire-os
./build/build.sh -bt <dev/oskr> -bp <boot-passwd> -v <build-increment>
# boot password not required for dev
# example: ./build/build.sh -bt dev -v 1
```

### Where is my OTA?

## Differences compared to normal Vector FW

-   New OS base
    -   Yocto Walnascar rather than Jethro
        -   glibc 2.41 (latest as of 04-2025)
-   `victor` software compiled with Clang 18.1.8 rather than 5.0.1
-   Rainbow eye color
    -   Can be activated in :8888/demo.html
-   Some Anki-era PRs have been merged
    -   Performances
        -   He will somewhat randomly do loosepixel and binaryeyes
    -   Better camera gamma correction
        -   He handles too-bright situations much better now
-   Picovoice wakeword engine
    -   Custom wake words in :8080 webserver!
-   `htop` and `rsync` are embedded
-   Python 3.13 rather than Python 2
-   Global SSH key: ([ssh_root_key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kercre123/unlocking-vector/refs/heads/main/ssh_root_key))

## Helpful scripts

-	`anki-debug`
	-	If you are debugging `victor` and want to see backtraces in /var/log/messages, run this to enable those.
-	`ddn <on/off>`
	-	Turns on/off DevDoNothing, which makes the bot stand still until shaken.

## Proprietary software notes

-	This repo contains lots of proprietary Qualcomm code and prebuilt software.
-	After a stupid amount of work, I have most HAL programs compiling under GCC 7.5.0 in Yocto.
-	This is only for audio and BLE. For camera, I decided to just copy in those binaries (mm-camera recipe).
-	If you want to change the code in mm-anki-camera or mm-qcamera-daemon for whatever reason, you'll have to clone vicos-oelinux-nosign, change the code there, compile it in there, then pack the built binaries into a --bzip2 tar and put it into prebuilt_HY11/mm-camera.
	-	Why am I not having Yocto build them? This is because I would have to add ~2GB of code to the repo, I would have to figure out how to get Qualcomm's ancient "SDLLVM" compiler working, and because the binaries are stable enough.

## How this upgrade was done

-	Much work upgrading Yocto recipes.
-	Most of the software is compiling with Yocto's GCC 14 or the Clang 18.1.8 toolchain I built, but there are some exceptions which are compiled with a GCC 7.5.0 compiler.
-	These exceptions include linux-msm (kernel), all the Qualcomm HAL programs, and ALSA (it didn't work right with the kernel when compiled with GCC 14).
-	Some recipes are still somewhat old - these include wpa_supplicant and connman (I had issues with SAE)
